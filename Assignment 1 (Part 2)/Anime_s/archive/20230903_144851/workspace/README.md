Given the requirements and assumptions, we will need to create a static web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will use the Fetch API to get data from the MyAnimeList API.

The core files, classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the web page.
2. `styles.css`: This CSS file will contain all the styles for the web page.
3. `main.js`: This JavaScript file will contain the logic for fetching data from the MyAnimeList API and manipulating the DOM.
4. `fetchAnimeData()`: This function will fetch data from the MyAnimeList API.
5. `populateDropdown()`: This function will populate the dropdown menu with genres and themes.
6. `displayTopRatedAnimes()`: This function will display the top-rated animes to the user.
7. `getRecommendations()`: This function will get anime recommendations based on the selected genre and theme.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

index.html
