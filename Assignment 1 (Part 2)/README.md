# Task: To showcase the power of integrating Vscode and generative AI
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

To integrate Vscode with a generative AI, I cloned gpt-engineer and followed the steps to set up the environment. 
Once that was done, I added a prompt to create a static website for anime recommendations based on genre. The prompt can be found at Anime_s --> prompt.  

Initially, Anime_s had only one file, that is 'prompt'. Applying gpt-engineer on the prompt all the other folders and files were generated. 
Check out 'Screen of Assignment 2.mp4' for a clear picture. It records the clarifications given to gpt-engineer after executing the prompt and also a clip of the website generated (CSS was manually edited a little to give the finishing touch).

All the generated files can be found in Anime_s
