# Task: To analyze a Kaggle dataset using a GPT4 advanced data analysis tool üìàüïµÔ∏è
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I downloaded a dataset called 'WineQuality.csv' from Kaggle. The dataset can be utilized to predict a wine's quality based on multiple features such as pH, acidity, alcohol, etc. As we already have a target column this is a supervised learning problem. 

Using the GPT4's Advanced Data Analysis tool I uploaded the dataset in the GPT4 environment and gave it a prompt on how to proceed with the analysis of the dataset.
A transcript of the same can be found, it's named 'GPT4 Transcript.pdf' 

The learnings and experience are recorded in the medium article:
