## ðŸŽ¯Task: Use pycaret for low code end to end ML projects

There are 5 simple steps in the pycaret workflow:

	1) Setup: Preprocessing and loading the dataset. 
 	2) Create model/Compare Models: Create a specific model or compare all the models applicable for the problem type 
  	   and pick the best one.
  	3) Analyze Models: Analyzing the model through visual plots.
   	4) Prediction: Applying the model on the test set.
	5) Saving Models: Saving the pipeline and weights of the tuned model in the form of a pkl file.
