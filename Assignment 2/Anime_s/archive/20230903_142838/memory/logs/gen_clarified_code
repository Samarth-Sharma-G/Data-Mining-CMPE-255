We will also use the requests library to make API calls to MyAnimeList.\n\nThe core classes and functions will include:\n\n1. `Anime`: A class to represent an anime with attributes like title, genre, theme, etc.\n2. `AnimeList`: A class to represent a list of animes. It will have methods to add an anime to the list and to get animes based on genre and theme.\n3. `get_anime_data`: A function to fetch anime data from MyAnimeList using the provided API key.\n4. `app`: The Flask application.\n5. `index`: The function to render the main page of the web application.\n6. `get_recommendations`: The function to handle the POST request when a user selects genres and themes and to return the recommended animes.\n\nNow, let's start with the entrypoint file, `app.py`.\n\napp.py\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request\nfrom anime import Anime, AnimeList\nfrom mal_api import get_anime_data\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef index():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        genres = request.form.getlist('genres')\n        themes = request.form.getlist('themes')\n        animes = get_anime_data(genres, themes)\n        return render_template('index.html', animes=animes)\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nNext, let's define the `Anime` and `AnimeList` classes in `anime.py`.\n\nanime.py\n```python\nclass Anime:\n    def __init__(self, title, genres, themes):\n        self.title = title\n        self.genres = genres\n        self.themes = themes\n\nclass AnimeList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.animes = []\n\n    def add_anime(self, anime):\n        self.animes.append(anime)\n\n    def get_animes(self, genres, themes):\n        return [anime for anime in self.animes if set(genres).intersection(anime.genres) and set(themes).intersection(anime.themes)]\n```\n\nThen, we define the `get_anime_data` function in `mal_api.py`.\n\nmal_api.py\n```python\nimport requests\n\nAPI_KEY = '3d2f9fd7cac3fea652fa4bb529f510f57c836036285a785bc198d5e69049b69d'\n\ndef get_anime_data(genres, themes):\n    response = requests.get(f'https://api.myanimelist.net/v2/anime?api_key={API_KEY}&fields=genres,themes')\n    data = response.json()\n    anime_list = AnimeList()\n    for anime in data['data']:\n        anime_list.add_anime(Anime(anime['title'], anime['genres'], anime['themes']))\n    return anime_list.get_animes(genres, themes)\n```\n\nFinally, we need to create the `index.html` file in the `templates` directory.\n\nindex.html\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Anime Recommendations</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <form method=\"POST\">\n        <label for=\"genres\">Select genres:</label><br>\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"action\" name=\"genres\" value=\"Action\">\n        <label for=\"action\">Action</label><br>\n        <!-- Add more genres here -->\n        <label for=\"themes\">Select themes:</label><br>\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"fantasy\" name=\"themes\" value=\"Fantasy\">\n        <label for=\"fantasy\">Fantasy</label><br>\n        <!-- Add more themes here -->\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Get Recommendations\">\n    </form>\n    {% if animes %}\n        <h2>Recommended Animes:</h2>\n        <ul>\n            {% for anime in animes %}\n                <li>{{ anime.title }}</li>\n            {% endfor %}\n        </ul>\n    {% endif %}\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nFor Python, we need to create a `requirements.txt` file to list the dependencies.\n\nrequirements.txt\n```txt\nflask\nrequests\n```\n\nTo run the application, first install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run `python app.py`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
