Assumptions:
1. The genres and themes to be included in the dropdown menu are: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Horror, Mystery, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller.
2. The anime recommendations will be fetched from the Kitsu API and will be based on the selected genre or theme.
3. The criteria for recommending an anime based on a selected genre or theme is that the anime must be tagged with the selected genre or theme.

The core files, classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the web application.
2. styles.css: This CSS file will contain all the styles for the web application.
3. main.js: This JavaScript file will contain all the logic for fetching and displaying the anime recommendations.
4. fetchAnimeData(): This function will fetch the anime data from the Kitsu API.
5. filterAnimeData(): This function will filter the fetched anime data based on the selected genre or theme.
6. displayAnimeData(): This function will display the filtered anime data on the web application.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
