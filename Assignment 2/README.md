# Task: To showcase the power of integrating Vscode and generative ai

To integrate Vscode with a generative ai, i cloned gpt-engineer and followed the steps to setup the environment. 
Once that was done, I added a prompt to create a static website for anime recommendation based on genre. Prompt can be found at Anime_s --> prompt.  

Initially Anime_s had only one file, that is 'prompt'. Applying gpt-engineer on the prompt all the other folders and files were generated. 
Checkout 'Screen of Assignment 2.mp4' for a clear picture. It records the clarifications given to gpt-engineer after executing the prompt and also a clip of the website generated (css was manually edited a little to give the finishing touch).

All the generated files can be foind in Anime_s
