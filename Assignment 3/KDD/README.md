As of 2023, approximately 537 million adults are living with diabetes. 
Advances in machine learning and data analytics offer promising approaches for developing predictive models that can assist healthcare 
professionals in early diagnosis and intervention. This research focuses on 
employing the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) methodology to develop a 
machine-learning model for predicting diabetic status
