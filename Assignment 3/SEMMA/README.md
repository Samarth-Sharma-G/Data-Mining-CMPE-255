The increasing demand for food security and quality has accelerated the need for efficient 
and accurate agricultural practices. One such avenue is the classification of rice grains, a 
staple food consumed globally. Traditional methods involve manual inspection and 
categorization, which are labor-intensive and prone to errors. Advances in machine learning 
offer a promising alternative for automating this classification process. This paper presents 
an approach to classify rice grains using the SEMMA methodology, employing a Random 
Forest classifier, and analyzes its efficacy and reliability.
